## Documentation Samples

[Jen's Edited SRA Tookit Wiki](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/tk_wiki/wiki)
  - Here is the [link to the **current** SRA Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki). My task was to edit a few pages to serve an audience that includes non-developers. My work is linked above. The team decided the work was too detailed for the GitHub and is currently scheduled to be added to the SRA website.

[Jen's Updated E-Utilities API Documentation](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/eutilities/blob/main/getting_started.md)
  - Here is the [link to the **current** E-Utilities API documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/). The documentation was written many years. My task is to re-organize the information and present it in a way that is more easier to understand. The team is not currently equiped to develop a website that enables interactivity, so I am creating a pseudosite here to show how I would organize a website (current as of Dec 2024). I attempted to write my first API yaml, which is included in the link above.
