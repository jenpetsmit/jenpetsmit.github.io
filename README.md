## Documentation Samples

[SRA Tookit Wiki](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/tk_wiki/wiki)
  - Here is the [link to the current SRA Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki). My task was to edit a few pages to serve an audience that includes non-developers. My work is linked above. The team decided the work was too detailed for the GitHub and is currently scheduled to be added to the SRA website.

[E-Utilities API Documentation](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/eutilities/blob/main/getting_started.md)
  - Here is the link to the current E-Utilities API documenation. The documenation was not written by a technical writer many years ago. My task was to re-organize the information and present it in a way that was more easy to understand. The team is not currently equiped to develope a website that enables interactivity;however, I attempted to write my first API yaml. The work is included in the link above.
