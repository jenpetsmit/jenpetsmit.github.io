## Documentation Samples


&nbsp;


### **NIH NCBI E-Utilities API documentation**

The [original documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/){:target="_blank"} was written several years. My task is to re-organize the information and present it in a way that is more easier to understand. This work is not currently funded to develop a website that enables >interactivity, so I am creating a pseudosite here to show how I would organize a website (current as of March 2024).

  - First attempt to write [my first API yaml](https://github.com/jenpetsmit/eutilities/blob/main/eutils/yml.md)

### **NIH NCBI SRA Toolkit Wiki**

My task was to edit a few of the [original pages](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki) to serve an audience that includes non-developers. The deveoper team (not the Product Manager) decided the work was too detailed for the GitHub. The work is currently scheduled to >be added to the SRA website.

### **NIH NCBI STAT Tool**

 My task was to create instructions for non-developers to download and use a new version the STAT Tool, a tool scientist would use to determine the taxomonmy of a biological sample. The [current information](https://github.com/ncbi/ngs-tools/tree/tax/tools/tax) does not include how to download the taxonomy database. The developer team discovered some weaknesses based on my attempts to set up the tool. They decided to reorganize the toolkit. Since the project manager is no longer with the organization, the future of this work is on hold.
