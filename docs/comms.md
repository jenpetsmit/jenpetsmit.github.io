# Communications Writing Samples

I started my technical writing career in 2015. Before then I created posters, flyers, and websites as part of my job as Technology Consultant at the College of Charleston School of Languages, Cultures, and World Affairs. 

For three years I was the Communications for the Louisiana State Medical Society writing the monthly newsletter, editing the scientific journal, and mainting the website. 

While in earning my Master in Arts in Professional Communications (MAPC) at Clemson University, I wrote the English Department Newsletter and produced a marketing video for the Clemson Botanical Gardens.
