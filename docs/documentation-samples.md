## **STAT Tool**

_~ Publishing on hold_

 For the NCBI STAT Tool, wrote guidance for a non-technicap audience to use a new version the STAT Tool, a tool scientist would use to determine the taxomonmy of a biological sample. 
 
 The current information does not include how to download the taxonomy database. The developer team discovered some weaknesses based on my attempts to set up the tool. They decided to reorganize the toolkit. Since the project manager is no longer with the organization, the future of this work is on hold.
