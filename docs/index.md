### About Me
 
I am a Senior Technical Writer with 10 years of experience with a Masterâ€™s degree in Professional Communications. 

* See my [technical writing samples](documentation-samples.md)

I am motivated to help end users achieve their goals by creating content that is human-centered, is visually appealing, and effectively enables clients to use the technology.  

My strengths are:

* Learning technology and writing instructional guidance (tech writing)
* Designing page layouts that guide the user through complex processes (UX)
* Creating or selecting visuals that effectively affect the audience using ethos, pathos, and logos (rhetorical comms)
