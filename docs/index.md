## About Me
 
I am a Senior Technical Writer with 10 years of experience and a Masterâ€™s degree in Professional Communications. 

I am motivated to help end users achieve their goals by creating content that is human-centered, is visually appealing, and effectively enables clients to use the technology.  

Before technical writing, I created internal and external organizational communications and graphic design (7 years) and marketing materials (6 years) and taught high school and college (2 years).

There is supposed to be a menu to the left, however I am teaching myself how to publish a static site and something is amok. 

Stay Tuned!
