# Welcome to Jen Smith's Portfolio

Hello and thanks for visiting!

I’ve worked as a technical writer since 2015, beginning with user instructions for the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS). From there, I documented system architecture and authored SOPs for a big data initiative for the U.S. Marine Corps. Currently, I support the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where I’m updating API documentation for the E-utilities. See my [MkDocs Site for NCBI API Documentation](https://eutilities.github.io/site/)

My foundation in communication comes from a Master of Arts in Professional Communications, where I learned to apply ethos (credibility), pathos (empathy), and logos (logic) across both technical and creative projects. Over the years, I’ve built websites, written blogs, and created marketing materials that are both user-focused and goal-driven.

I rely on these core principles in all my professional writing:

* Clean, user-friendly visual design
* Clear and practical language to support content aligned with a specific user goal


 * [Work Samples](documentation-samples.md)
 * [Organizational Communications](visuals.md)
 * Learning New Tech
    * [YAML](yaml.md)
    * [Web Crawler for YouTube Videos](webcrawler.md)
 * [Resume](resume.md)
